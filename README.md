# Invisible-Man-using-MaskRCNN-
This project helps in human detection using the concepts of Bounding boxes, there after the detection it will erase the human's in the output streaming video.  This is real time working model helpful in erasing the humans from the video using deep learning techniques.

This ia a deep learning python project, which comprises of 3 modules, the first module is Invisible man is an updated version of MaskRCNN, it contains accuracy measures and fps(Frames per second) and so on. the second and third models are existing models which rely on MaskRCNN and Deeplab V3. Firstly to implement this project, i recommend you to choose a high performing GPU and HighDefinition webcam as it is a high level project. There were two consoles visible to you while you are implementing the project, input console and an output console. Input console takes the input through webcam and detects the humans through techquinue called Bounding boxes, there after it erases the humans and replaces it with the surrounding existing background. This project had gained 100% accuracy. The total accuracy measures are added in the project report, if necessary. The total project along with reports are attached in this repository.
